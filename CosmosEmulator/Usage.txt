Usage: Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Emulator.exe [/Shutdown]  [options]
/AllowNetworkAccess      Allows access to the Emulator over the network.
                         Note you must also pass /Key=<key_string> or /KeyFile=<file_name> to enable network access
/CassandraPort=<port>    Port number to use for the Cassandra Endpoint (API must be enabled first). Default is 10350.
/ComputePort=<port>      Port number to use for the Compute Interop Gateway service. The Gateway's HTTP endpoint
                         probe port is calculated as ComputePort + 79. Hence, ComputePort and ComputePort + 79 must
                         be open and available. The defaults is 8900, 8979.
/Consistency=<value>     Sets the default consistency level for the account. Value must be one of:
                         Session, Strong, Eventual, or BoundedStaleness. Default is Session
/DataPath=<path>         Path to store data files. Defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\CosmosDbEmulator
/DefaultPartitionCount=<count>
                         Default number of 10GB partitions reserved for a partitioned collection. Default is 25.
/DirectPorts=<port-list> Comma-separated list of 4 ports to use for direct connectivity. Default is 10251,10252,10253,
                         10254.
/DisableRateLimiting     Disables rate limiting simulation
/EnableCassandraEndpoint Enables Cassandra API
/EnableGremlinEndpoint   Enables Gremlin API
/EnableMongoDbEndpoint   Enables the legacy MongoDB API version 3.2; this option will be deprecated in favor of /EnableMongoDbEndpoint=<ver> option
/EnableMongoDbEndpoint=<ver>
                         Enables MongoDB API version <ver>. The current supported version are: 3.2, 3.6, 4.0 and 4.2
/EnablePreview           Enables preview features for the SQL API endpoint
/EnableRateLimiting      Enables request rate limiting simulation
/EnableTableEndpoint     Enables Azure Table API
/FailOnSslCertificateNameMismatch
                         By default the Emulator regenerates its self-signed SSL certificate, if the certificate's SAN does
                         not include the Emulator host's domain name, local IPv4 address, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'. With
                         this option, the Emulator will fail at startup instead. You should then use the /GenCert option to
                         create and install a new self-signed SSL certificate.
/GenCert[=<dns-names>]   Generates and installs a new self-signed SSL certificate, optionally including a comma-separted
                         list of additional DNS names for accessing the Emulator over the network.
/GenKeyFile=<filename>   Generates a new authorization key and save to the specified file.
                         The generated key can be used with the /Key or /KeyFile options
/GetStatus               Gets the status of the Azure Cosmos Emulator. The status is indicated by the exit code:
                         1 = Starting, 2 = Running, 3 = Stopped
/GremlinPort=<port>      Port number to use for the Gremlin Endpoint (API must be enabled first). Default is 8901.
/Key=<key_string>        Authorization key for the emulator. Key must be the base 64 encoding of a 64 byte vector.
/KeyFile=<file_name>     Reads authorization key from the specified file. Use the /GenKeyFile option to generate a keyfile
/MongoPort=<port>        Port number to use for the Mongo compatibility. Default is 10250.
/NoExplorer              Don't show Data Explorer on startup.
/NoFirewall              Don't adjust firewall rules when /AllowNetworkAccess is used.
/NoUI                    Don't show any emulator UI.
/PartitionCount=<count>  Total number of 10GB partitions allocated for data storage. Default is 25. Maximum is 250.
/Port=<port>             Port number to use for the Emulator gateway service. Default is 8081.
/ResetDataPath[=<path>]  Recursively removes all the files in the specified path; if no path is specified it defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\CosmosDbEmulator

/Shutdown                Shutdown the running Emulator instance.
/StartTraces             Start collecting debug trace logs.
/StopTraces              Stop collecting debug trace logs.
/TablePort=<port>        Port number to use for the Azure Table Endpoint (API must be enabled first). Default is 8902.
